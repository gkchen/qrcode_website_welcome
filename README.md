# qrcode_website_welcome

This is a simple script that generates a QR code for a WiFi network in various formats including .png, .svg, and .png. After QR code generation, the rendered template.tex is compiled and a welcome.pdf file is written out.

To run the script, ensure the requirements outlined in requirements.txt are installed. In a terminal, run
```
python main.py [location] [config.json]
```

And that's it!
